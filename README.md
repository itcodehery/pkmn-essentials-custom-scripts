This repository contains a collection of custom **Ruby** scripts designed for use with the **Pokemon Essentials Toolkit** within **RPG Maker XP**. These scripts were developed to enhance gameplay mechanics, add new UI elements, and streamline event management for custom Pokemon fangames.

## Included Scripts

The collection includes the following modules:

*   **Overworld Utilities (Healing Spots)**
    *   simplifies the process of setting custom respawn points and healing locations (Pokemon Centers, player's house, etc.) directly from map events.

*   **Diary System (Logic & UI)**
    *   **Logic**: A flexible backend system to track player progress, story beats, and personal notes.
    *   **UI**: A custom user interface integrated into the pause menu, allowing players to browse their diary entries.

*   **Mission System**
    *   A comprehensive framework for managing quests and campaigns.
    *   Supports multi-stage objectives, distinct mission states (Active, Completed, Failed), and variable tracking.

*   **Mission Log UI**
    *   A visual component for the Mission System.
    *   Provides a clean, organized list of missions where players can check their current objectives and review completed tasks.

*   **Custom Intro Scene**
    *   A scriptable alternative to the standard "Professor Oak" introduction.
    *   Allows for more cinematic and narrative-driven game openings.

## Pokemon Trailokya

These scripts are currently being developed for and used in **Pokemon Trailokya**, a personal fangame project of mine.

*   **Engine**: Pokemon Essentials (RPG Maker XP)
*   **Story**: A brand-new, darker narrative featuring branching endings.
*   **Content**: Over 400+ Pokemon to catch and train, accompanied by original music.
